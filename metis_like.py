# metis_like.py
# Pure-Python METIS-like multilevel k-way partitioning (weighted graph).
# - Coarsening: heavy-edge matching
# - Initial partition: greedy graph growing with balance
# - Uncoarsen: project + greedy boundary refinement (gain-based single-vertex moves)
#
# Inputs:
#   adjacency: List[List[int]]    neighbors per vertex
#   eweights:  List[List[int]]    aligned weights per neighbor
#   nparts: int
#   vweights: Optional[List[int]] vertex weights (default 1)
#   seed: int
#
# Output:
#   parts: List[int] of length n, each in [0, nparts-1]
